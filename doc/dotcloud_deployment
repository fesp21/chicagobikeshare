Deploying Shareabouts on dotcloud.com
======================================

Preparation
=============

1. Get a dotcloud API key.
2. Install the dotcloud command line app.
3. Get a Facebook app ID and secret.


First Deployment
=================

From the root of your shareabouts source tree:

 dotcloud create shareabouts
 dotcloud var set shareabouts FACEBOOK_APP_ID=<your facebook app id>
 dotcloud var set shareabouts FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=<your facebook app secret>

Now do your first deployment:

 dotcloud push shareabouts .
 dotcloud run shareabouts.www -- rake -f current/Rakefile db:create db:migrate db:seed

That should take care of everything.

Note that if you have local changes to your shareabouts code,
you must commit them before running ``dotcloud push``.

If the build finishes but you get errors from the server, ssh in (by
doing "dotcloud ssh shareabouts1") and check
/home/dotcloud/current/log/production.log

Pushing Updates
================

From the root of your shareabouts source tree:

 dotcloud push shareabouts .
 dotcloud run shareabouts.www -- rake -f current/Rakefile db:migrate

Caveats
=======

dotcloud doesn't have ogr2ogr installed so it's not possible currently
to upload shapefiles in projections other than 4326.
