Shareabouts is a simple web app for crowdsourced mapping. We're in very early stages right now, so expect many rough edges. [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/openplans/shareabouts.png)](http://travis-ci.org/openplans/shareabouts)


Shareabouts is intended for simple mapping applications. For example, you could use it to collect public input on suitable locations for stations in a city-wide bike share.

The project is open source, and we welcome your involvement.

Requirements and a setup guide are located at doc/README_FOR_APP.
